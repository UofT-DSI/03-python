        "\n",
        "**Objective**: In this assignment, your task is to utilize Python programming skills to evaluate the effectiveness of a fictional medication designed to reduce inflammation caused by arthritis flare-ups.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Background**: Imagine a clinical trial where 60 patients were administered a new drug for arthritis. Data from this trial has been recorded in a series of CSV files. Evaluate the effectiveness of a fictional medication designed to reduce inflammation caused by arthritis flare-ups.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Data Structure**:\n",
        "- Each CSV file corresponds to a specific check-in session with the patients.\n",
        "- There are 12 such CSV files, reflecting 12 different sessions where patients reported their experiences.\n",
        "- Inside each file:\n",
        "  - Rows: Each of the 60 rows represents a unique patient.\n",
        "  - Columns: Each of the 40 columns corresponds to a day, detailing the number of inflammation flare-ups the patient experienced on that day.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Your Role**: Analyze this data to determine how effective the new drug has been in managing arthritis inflammation across the trial period."

        "The `check_zeros(x)` function is provided as a tool to assist with your data analysis. While you do not need to modify or fully understand the internal workings of this function, it's important to grasp its input, output, and what the output signifies:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Input**:\n",
        "   - **Parameter `x`**: This function takes an array of numbers as its input. In the context of your assignment, this array will typically represent a set of data points from your patient data, such as mean inflammation scores.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Output**:\n",
        "   - The function returns a boolean value: either `True` or `False`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Interpreting the Output**:\n",
        "   - **Output is `True`**: This indicates that the array `x` contains at least one zero value. In the context of your analysis, this means that at least one patient has a mean inflammation score of 0, signaling a potential issue or anomaly in the data.\n",
        "   - **Output is `False`**: This signifies that there are no zero values in the array `x`. For your patient data, it means no patient has a mean inflammation score of 0, and thus no apparent anomalies of this type were detected.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Usage in Your Analysis**:\n",
        "When using `check_zeros(x)` in conjunction with your `patient_summary()` function in the `detect_problems()` function, you'll be checking whether any patient in your dataset has an average (mean) inflammation score of 0."
